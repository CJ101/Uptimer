# Uptimer
Python network uptime/outage logger

## Why?
 I want a tangible, visual representation of how often my connection goes out every day, thanks to AT&T. Works for any connection, and will yield a CSV file as a log.
 
## TODO
 charting of outage occurrence/duration, optional mailer.
 
## Dependencies
 PyQt5, schedule, socket, win10Ttoast
